Hello, my name is Sahan Wijewardane and I am currently conducting a research study for the MUE 705 “Current Trends in Music Engineering” class, alongside supervision from Dr. Tom Collins.


PURPOSE OF STUDY:
We are asking you to take part in a research study to learn more about the correlation between objective and subjective evaluations of music source separation (MSS) model performance. You will be asked to take part in a Qualtrics survey using a computer or phone. Throughout the study, you will be asked to rate audio stimuli based on a few criteria, including presence of external artifacts and overall quality. The given audio stimuli will consist of one of two categories (bass or drums). There will also be some questions asking you to report on the quality of your listening environment and your familiarity with the technologies involved.



Risks involved in participating in this study are as follows:
• You may become bored or irritated because of the length of the study.

• You may be fatigued by repeated listening to audio stimuli
Benefits involved in participating in this study are as follows:

• Being a part of a study that aims to shed light on a significant and timely topic


You will not be paid for participating in this research study. The study is private. The researchers will not share what they learn about you in a way that is tied to your identity. The researchers working on the study and the part of the government that makes the rules about research will need to see what is learned, but they are not allowed to tell anyone about you. If you are a student, your decision not to join this study or to withdraw from the study will not affect your grades or other academic standings at the University of Miami. If you are an employee of the University of Miami (UM), your decision not to join this study or to withdraw from the study will not affect your employment at the University of Miami System. Study responses will be kept private and anonymous. We will not store your name or any other personal information. Your participation is voluntary. You can decline to participate, and you can stop your participation at any time, if you wish to do so, without any negative consequences to you. By checking the box below, you consent to participate in this research project.



If you have any questions or concerns about the research, please feel free to contact me at sxw1454@miami.edu or the principal investigator, Dr. Tom Collins, at tom.collins@miami.edu If you have questions regarding your rights as a research participant, contact the University of Miami, Human Subject Research Office at (305) 243-3195.","IMPORTANT:

 

Accurately completing this survey requires critical listening across the audible spectrum. For that reason it is highly encouraged that you take this survey with a quality playback device and in a quiet listening environment. You will be asked to self-report both the state of your listening environment and what playback device you are using.",How old are you?,How do you describe yourself? - Selected Choice,How do you describe yourself? - Prefer to self-describe - Text,"What playback device (i.e. laptop speakers, headphones, etc.) are you taking this survey on?","Rate the quality of your listening environment, from 1 (dreadful) to 5 (pristine): - Quality of Listening Environment","Rate your familiarity with music source separation, from 1 (Completely unfamiliar) to 5 (Extremely familiar): - Familiarity with music source separation","Rate your familiarity with assessing the quality of audio recordings, from 1 (Completely unfamiliar) to 5 (Extremely familiar): - Familiarity with audio quality assessment","Please listen to all of the separated drums sources below.
